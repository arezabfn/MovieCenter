--  I am very glad that you want to use my Project --

To use the project :

1- You need to create table 'video' in the database called 'video'
 
2- Then you need to configure the database Database name, username and password

3- You Must Set Project Name 'MovieCenter' Not 'MovieCenter-main'

4- For Upload File Without Limited You Must Change Two Value in 'php.ini'

;Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
 upload_max_filesize = 40M //You Must Change This Value 

; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize
 post_max_size = 40M 	  //You Must Change This Value 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I Put a query named 'video.sql' in the project path, which you can inject into the database and create the table
